# Overview
Very simple Web App that allowed me to better understand and utilze Django.  This projects mocks a "project page" that a prospective web developer would want.  It dynamically 
generates a web page with projects stored in a database.  Each project can be click on which redirects to a new page with more details.

# Web Pages

1. Projects page - This page runs a for loop pulling all saved projects from the database.  The projects are displayed in cards and presented to the user.
2. Project Details - clicking on a project will result in the project details page, where the user can see a short discription along with the technologies used
